# Overview

### The Problem
Many UH students have musical talents, but there is no easy way for them to find others with similar tastes and compatible musical abilities. Thus, they cannot experience the fun of informal jam sessions which could progress into performing musical groups.

### The Solution
The [Music Match](https://github.com/music-match/music-match) application allows students to login and create a profile indicating their musical tastes, their musical capabilities, and their musical goals (from occasional, informal jam sessions to performing bands). The profile can also include links to YouTube videos or SoundCloud tracks with examples of their musicianship.

# Approach
Once a profile is created, others can browse the profiles filtered by specific tastes, capabilities, and goals to find compatible musicians to contact.

Students can also set up notifications to find out automatically when a profile is created that satisfies criteria that they specify.

Admins can monitor the site for inappropriate content, and create new categories of musical tastes, capabilities, and goals.

Some mockup pages include:
- Landing page
- User home page
- Admin home page
- User profile page.
- Browse users by taste, ability, instrument, goals, etc.

# Deployment

[Music Match](http://143.198.236.70/) is available live!

# User Interface
These will be the mockup pages that will be used as a basis for this final project.
